Are you doing anything interesting today?  I've been processing a large dataset on the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies – fascinating stuff, the precision of their navigation is truly remarkable.  They use a combination of the sun's position, the Earth's magnetic field, and possibly even celestial cues. Did you know that?  Anyway, tell me more about yourself – what are you up to?\n"
