      "Mastering MCQs: The Ultimate Guide | by Vishwajeet Ohal | MediumSitemapOpen in appSign upSign inMedium LogoWriteSign upSign inMastering MCQs: The Ultimate GuideVishwajeet Ohal6 min read·Apr 18, 2021--ListenSharePress enter or click to view image in full sizePhoto by Green Chameleon on UnsplashWith a massive shift of paradigm initiated by the global pandemic, many organizations and educational institutions have moved online and subsequently have adapted the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) structure of examinations. That is why students of the online age undoubtedly need to adjust their way of preparing for their academic evaluation, and to do exactly that, I have constructed a comprehensive guide — using the knowledge, I have gained over 10 years of participation in Olympiads and other exams — to approach MCQs and ace your next examinations. This guide will not only help you for your University examinations, but also for competitive exams like GATE, GRE and GMAT among others.It is easier to divide the approach in two phases: Preparation Phase and Problem Solving Phase.1. Preparation Phase.While preparing for an MCQ exam, we should ideally steer clear of the conventional strategy students often use for written examinations. Since the MCQs are structured in a way that rewards a test-taker’s understanding and expertise of a topic, simply memorizing textbooks by heart will never give the best results. So what should you do?Tip #1: Visualize your Work.While studying, take conscious efforts to visualize and run mini-simulations of the topic in your mind. Visualizing changes how our brain networks are organized, creating more connections among different regions. This also helps to identify gaps in your understanding so that you can work upon them. While this is an effective technique for studying in general, it works even better here since MCQs are specifically designed to test those little details and nuances of the topic that most people do not pay enough attention to. If visualization does not come naturally to you, try making some sketches or flowcharts or any other appropriate visual representation. This will help you get started, prepare beautiful notes along the way and allow you to gradually move towards the ultimate aim of doing this mentally.Tip #2: Minimize memorization.Humans can remember a limited amount of information for a short period. Memorizing less information lets you spend more time on what really matters — building a higher understanding of a particular topic. To make the most of our valuable mental resources, I find it best to only memorize general definitions and formulae for numerical problems. However, if we have strong understanding, we can even recall and derive a few of the simpler formulae on the fly! Do this along with Tip #1 and you’re all set to remember concepts for long periods of time, especially beneficial for competitive exams whose preparations go on for multiple months.Tip #3: Make mental notes of points that can be used to generate questions.As you might know, a simple point can be asked in different ways in an attempt to confuse a student. Imagining ways of asking a question helps a lot to anticipate the question types and it feels amazingly satisfying when you see a question that you already had thought of while studying. Be mindful, starting to use this technique will slow you down at first, but as your brain gets enough practice, it will start to do it subconsciously and over time, you will become far better and faster at it than you think you can.2. Problem Solving Phase.Just like for written exams, practice gives a huge advantage and can make the difference between achieving and average score and a high score. Fortunately, MCQ resources are easy to find on the internet to practice the strategies that I will discuss below.Tip #4: Anticipate the answer.The sight of multiple options confuses a vast number of students, but it we can tackle it easily by predicting an answer and selecting the one that is closest to your prediction. Although this can be very useful, we must have an extra layer of vigilance for competitive exams as they intentionally place a very appealing but also very incorrect option to fool us. Check the example below for more clarity on this.Tip #5: Collect all Clues.This works hand-in-hand with Tip #2 (see above) to reduce the pressure of memorizing all information. A question can have hidden clues or implicit meanings that can help us to anticipate a correct answer given that we keep an eye out for them. Furthermore, if anticipation an answer is not possible, briefly going over the options to gain more information about the context and stem of the question will definitely help align our thoughts on the way to choosing the correct option.Tip #6: Elimination.Arguably, elimination is the most effective technique for solving MCQs, which you might already be aware of. But in reality, very few actually know how to strategically and algorithmically eliminate options. The idea here is to spot and eliminate specific types of incorrect options in non-numerical type of questions, and to establish that, we remember the acronym “IDEA”I — Irrelevant: Eliminate any off-topic or off-point optionsD — Distortion: Eliminate options with altered connotations. That is to eliminate falsely positive or falsely negative statements with respect to the anticipated answer.E — Exaggeration: Often times, in a valid point is stated in an extreme manner. Always be cautious of extreme terms like always, never, largest, minimum etc.A — Absurd: Eliminate anything that defies common sense right away. Apparently, the examiners like to add this kind of options occasionally as a joke.Example: Let’s see these techniques in action!Fill the blank in the way that best completes the text.Recognizing the ________ momentum of popular opinion for greater emphasis on sports, university presidents have called for swift steps to correct imbalances between classwork and athletics.A) RationalB) Maximum C) FleetingD) FutileE) IncreasingClues and Explanation:The second half of the sentence mentions swift steps taken by university presidents to correct imbalances between classwork and athletics, which resulted from the recognition that popular opinion was increasingly favoring a ‘greater emphasis on sports’. Hence, we anticipate an answer that would make similar sense.Elimination:Option A: eliminated as ‘rational’ does not suggest urgency for implementing changes Option B: eliminated as ‘maximum’ refers to a ‘peak’ that is not discussed Option C: eliminated as ‘fleeting’ would indicate that the emphasis was transitory or temporary Option D: eliminated as ‘futile’ would negate the intended meaning of the sentence Option E: correct answer choiceNotice how we are supposed to interpret the problem, anticipate an answer using our own logic and finally discard the incorrect options.Tip #7: Practice, Practice & Practice!If you still feel do not feel completely comfortable with the MCQ structure yet, solve high-school level Olympiad question papers. Trust me, they’re the best place to practice MCQs without the need of worrying too much about the content.For competitive examinations, keeping a healthy balance between practice and reading will take you farther than enormously large amounts of simply reading.Conclusion.All of the strategies and techniques talked about above will bear fruit only if you scrupulously implement them within your study routine. Remembering all these points while studying can be a bit overwhelming, so I advise that you choose one technique that resonates within you the most and add it into your methodology. After you get a hang of it, try adding the rest of the techniques on by one in your subsequent study sessions.I strongly believe anyone can use the above procedures to up their game and bring them that much closer to achieving their goals and realizing their dreams.A last thing I would like to share is something that I came across which completely pivoted the way I view education. I hope it helps you do the same! Good Luck!Shift your perspective from “I have to learn this” to “I get to learn this”McqsExamExam PreparationUniversityGuides And Tutorials----Written by Vishwajeet Ohal0 followers·2 followingChapter Lead at CodeChef SCOE Chapter, Machine Learning Enthusiast, Guitarist, Youtuber and Computer Engineering Student at SCOE.No responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech\n",
